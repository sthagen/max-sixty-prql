SELECT TOP 20 title, country, AVG(salary) AS average_salary, SUM(salary) AS sum_salary, AVG(salary + payroll_tax) AS average_gross_salary, SUM(salary + payroll_tax) AS sum_gross_salary, AVG(salary + payroll_tax + benefits_cost) AS average_gross_cost, SUM(salary + payroll_tax + benefits_cost) AS sum_gross_cost, COUNT(*) AS ct FROM employees WHERE start_date &amp;gt; DATE(&amp;#39;2021-01-01&amp;#39;) AND salary + payroll_tax + benefits_cost &amp;gt; 0 GROUP BY title, country HAVING COUNT(*) &amp;gt; 200 ORDER BY sum_gross_cost, country DESC Even this simple query demonstrates some of the problems with SQL&amp;rsquo;s lack of abstractions:</description></item><item><title>FAQ</title><link>https://prql-lang.org/faq/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prql-lang.org/faq/</guid><description>Cool story Hansel, but what can I actually do with PRQL now? We&amp;rsquo;re still early, and the opportunities for using PRQL are focused on two integrations:
dbt-prql allows writing PRQL in dbt models. It very simple to use — install dbt-prql with pip, and then any text between a {% prql %} &amp;amp; {% endprql %} tag is compiled from PRQL. Jupyter allows writing PRQL in a Jupyter notebook or IPython repl, with a %%prql magic.</description></item><item><title>Roadmap</title><link>https://prql-lang.org/roadmap/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prql-lang.org/roadmap/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;re excited and inspired by the level of enthusiasm behind the project, both from individual contributors and the broader community of users who are unsatisfied with SQL. We currently have an working version for the intrepid users.
We&amp;rsquo;re hoping we can build a beautiful language, integrations that are approachable &amp;amp; powerful, and a vibrant community. Many projects have reached the current stage and fallen, so this requires compounding on what we&amp;rsquo;ve done so far.</description></item></channel></rss>
