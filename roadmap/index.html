from individual contributors and the broader community of users who are
unsatisfied with SQL. We currently have an initial working version for the
intrepid early user.</p><p>I&rsquo;m hoping we can build a beautiful language, an app that&rsquo;s approachable &
powerful, and a vibrant community. Many projects have reached the current stage
and fallen, so this requires compounding on what we&rsquo;ve done so far.</p><h3 id=language-design>Language design</h3><p>Already since becoming public, the language has improved dramatically, thanks to
the feedback of dozens of contributors. The current state of the basics is now
stable and while we&rsquo;ll hit corner-cases, I expect we&rsquo;ll only make small changes
to the existing features — even as we continue adding features.</p><p>Feel free to post questions or continue discussions on <a href="https://github.com/prql/prql/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Alanguage-design">Language Design
Issues</a>.</p><h3 id=documentation>Documentation</h3><p>Currently the language documentation is at <a href=https://prql-lang.org/reference>https://prql-lang.org/reference</a>.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re up for contributing and don&rsquo;t have a preference for writing code or
not, this is the area that would most benefit from your contribution. Issues are
tagged with
<a href=https://github.com/prql/prql/labels/documentation>documentation</a>.</p><h3 id=friendliness>Friendliness</h3><p>Currently the language implementation is not sufficiently friendly, despite
significant recent improvements. We&rsquo;d like to make error messages better, sand
off sharp corners, etc.</p><p>Both bug reports of unfriendliness, and code contributions to improve them are
welcome; there&rsquo;s a
<a href="https://github.com/prql/prql/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Afriendlienss+is%3Aopen">friendliness</a>
label.</p><h3 id=fast-feedback>Fast feedback</h3><p>As well as a command-line tool that transpiles queries, we&rsquo;d like to make
developing in PRQL a wonderful experience, where it feels like it&rsquo;s on your
side:</p><ul><li>Syntax highlighting in more editors; currently we have a basic <a href=https://github.com/prql/prql-code>VSCode
extension</a>.</li><li>Initial type-inference, where it&rsquo;s possible without connecting to the DB, e.g.
<a href=https://github.com/prql/prql/pull/55>#55</a>.</li><li>Improvements or integrations to the <a href=https://prql-lang.org/playground/>live in-browser
compiler</a>, including querying actual
tables.</li><li>(I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s more, ideas welcome)</li></ul><h3 id=integrations>Integrations</h3><p>PRQL is focused at the language layer, which means we can easily integrate with
existing tools & apps. This will be the primary way that people can start using
PRQL day-to-day. Probably the most impactful initial integrations will be tools that
engineers use to build data pipelines, like
<a href=https://github.com/prql/prql/issues/375><code>dbt-prql</code></a>.</p><h3 id=database-cohesion>Database cohesion</h3><p>One benefit of PRQL over SQL is that auto-complete, type-inference, and
error checking can be much more powerful.</p><p>We&rsquo;d like to build this out. It&rsquo;s more difficult to build, since it requires a
connection to the database in order to understand the schema of the table.</p><h3 id=not-in-focus>Not in focus</h3><p>We should focus on solving a distinct problem really well. PRQL&rsquo;s goal is to
make reading and writing analytical queries easier, and so for the moment that
means putting some things out of scope:</p><ul><li>Building infrastructure outside of queries, like lineage. dbt is excellent at
that! (<a href=https://github.com/prql/prql/issues/13>#13</a>).</li><li>Writing DDL / index / schema manipulation / inserting data
(<a href=https://github.com/prql/prql/issues/16>#16</a>).</li></ul></article></main><footer>© 2022, PRQL developers. Apache 2.0 Licensed</footer></body></html>
